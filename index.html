                Guys! What can I say, today Chelsea lost to Newcastle. Yes! Newcastle. Another team from the lower half of the league table.
                I have a thought. My life, and my life club both are going through some period of changes. We are down, dim, not at their best, 
                a generic negativity in the air. Making drastic life changes to try and make it work. To bring it to its previous glory. I mean the 
                club and my life both.</br>
                
                </br>
                Don't get me wrong, I am not a loner. I have friends in the total amount of ZERO (hahahah got you!)</br>
                I entered 2020 with zero friends. I credit it to my 2020 vision. Meaning I have seen and tried all my friends
                to find all of them to be (in Asgardian terms) "Not Worthy!". I do think of my friendship to be as heavy as the mighty
                Mjolnir (the famous hammer of Thor: God of Thunder) and a very few have been able to lift it slightly from the ground but most of them
                have failed. Alas! no good friends for me. Did I ever care? No. I am an aquarian, and we are good at moving on given our
                never failing instict of selfishness. We want the best for us. Period.
